# 🔗 DSA Project - Linked List Operations in C

This project is a **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** implementation focused on **Linked List operations** in C.  
It was developed as part of my engineering coursework to strengthen understanding of pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and node manipulation.

## ⚙️ Features Implemented

- ✅ Create a Singly Linked List (SLL)
- ➕ Insert nodes (at beginning, end, or specific position)
- ❌ Delete nodes (by value or position)
- 🔁 Reverse the list
- 🔍 Search for a node
- ✏️ Update node value
- ➗ Split or skip alternate nodes
- ➕ Addition of two linked lists (digit-wise)
- 🧹 Remove nodes based on a condition (e.g., greater than X)
